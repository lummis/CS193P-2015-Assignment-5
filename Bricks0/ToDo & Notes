Sometimes a brick gets out of gameView. Could verify every brick is within gameView frequently,
maybe once per timer tick, and just remove any that are not.

The logic of the Bool showGameTime seems simple but it keeps being messed up.

When launched need to sync the settings view with the state of the parameters gotten from
user defaults.

In settings view show the parameter values in the table

Play time label should start at 0 when the game is reset

Changing number of rows with stepper in the Settings scene sometimes? doesn't have an effect in
the Play scene.

Find a way to change color of bricks in the bottom region and ready to be removed.

When ball is brought back from being lost set its velocity to 0.
