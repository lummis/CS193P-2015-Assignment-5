Implements Assignment 5 for the online Stanford course CS193P "Developing iOS 8 Apps with Swift".

The assignment is to build a version of the old Breakout game. This version of the game is pretty
stupid but uses many different features of Swift and the iOS API. The point is to demonstrate your
ability to use the language features, not to make a good game.
